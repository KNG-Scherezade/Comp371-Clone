# comp-371-procedural-generation-project

Loads a raster image and renders a 3D surface by mapping brightness at a given location to surface height at the corresponding location.

Works on macOS and Linux. Should work for Windows, but not recently tested.

## Features

* Load a 2D heightmap image and render it as a 3D model
* Swap between different model variations at the tap of a button
* View the model from any camera angle

### Starting the app

1. Before a window appears, you will be prompted to enter an image filename to load. If you don't care, a default will be used.
2. As soon as the program performs the initial 3D model render, the rendering will pause and you will need to enter a skip size for point reduction.
3. You will also need to enter a step size for point interpolation frequency.
4. Now you can explore the world generated by your heightmap.

### Controls

* Press 1, 2, 3 or 4 to view:
    1. The initial model rendered directly from the heightmap
    2. The reduced-point model
    3. The reduced-point model with added interpolated points along the x axis
    4. The previous model, with full interpolation along the z axis as well
* Press P to switch to points mode, L to switch to lines mode and T to switch to triangles mode
* Use WASD or the arrow keys to move the player forward, back, left or right
* Click the window with the left mouse button to capture the mouse and enter camera look mode
* Move the mouse in camera look mode to rotate about the player and change the forward direction
* Press escape to exit camera look mode, and get your mouse back
* Press the grave/backtick button (`) to toggle the visibility of the X, Y and Z axes (hidden by default)
* Press backspace to reset the model and camera. **You will be asked to re-enter skip size and step size information at the command line.**

## Building

### Dependencies

Beyond the C++ standard library this application relies on:
* OpenGL
* GLFW
* GLEW
* GLM
* STB (particularly the stb_image.h header library)

(Following standard setup procedure in a CMake-compatible IDE should fetch all these dependencies for you, so you shouldn't need to download them separately.)

### Other help

* Starter skeleton code adapted from [LearnOpenGL.com](https://learnopengl.com/) (including inspiration for [camera direction movement](https://learnopengl.com/#!Getting-started/Camera) and COMP 371 at Concordia University
* Cross platform CMake setup created using [Hunter](https://github.com/ruslo/hunter)
* Camera direction mouse movement partially modeled after tutorial
* Thanks to the COMP 371 TAs and my classmates for helping me think through some of these tougher problems
